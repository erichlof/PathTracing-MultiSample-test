# PathTracing-MultiSample-test
A Test/gathering feedback for adding Multi-Sampling (more than 1 sample per animation frame) to the three.js PathTracing Renderer.
Game Engine Path Tracer

<h4>Added Controls (Desktop Only)</h4>

* '-' and '+'  --> Decrease/Increase Samples per frame (range: 1-100, note: a powerful dedicated GPU is needed beyond 8 samples)
* '<' and '>'  --> Decrease/Increase amount of previous Frame Blending (range: 0.0 - 0.98, not quite 1.0 or the image would never update)
